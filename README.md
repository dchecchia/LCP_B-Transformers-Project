# LCP_B-Transformers-Project

Group Project for the Laboratory of Computational Physics mod.B course.

The Project consisted of analyzing **simulated** and **measured** data from plasma fusion event, in order to predict system anomalies a certain time before occurrence.

This was achieved by employing simple **Deep Neural Networks**, **Convolutional Neural Networks** and **Transformer** models to a **time-series** structured dataset.

Made using Keras, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn and Matplotlib Python Libraries.

Project was submitted and evaluated in mid-June 2023.
